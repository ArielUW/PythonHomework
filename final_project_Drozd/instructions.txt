Programming basics and technical data analysis â€“ final project

Create a new code repository on GitHub. Create a folder called final_project_name, into which you upload data in .csv format and a Python notebook file in .ipynb format.
Upon completion, return the link to the repository in Google Classroom.

Part 1 - Processing and cleaning the data

Replace abbreviated weekday names with english equivalents (full weekday names) - created_at column
Replace abbreviated month names with numerical equivalents (e.g. Jun to 06) - user_created_at column
Get all links to tweets and pass them to the list
Get all links found in tweets and pass them to the list (urls column)
Get all image links and pass them to the list (media column)
Remove all words marked as stopwords and pass the cleaned text to a new column called text_without_stopwords.

Part 2 - Exploratory data analysis

List the top 5 tweets with the highest number of likes.
List the top 5 tweets with the highest number of retweets.
Show only tweets that are not considered 'sensitive' (possibly_sensitive column).
Show the tweets of the user who created the account earliest (of all users in the dataset) (user_created_at column).
Show the tweets of the user with the most followers.
Show only verified users (user_verified column).
Indicate on which day of the week the tweets in the dataset were most frequently published.

Part 3 - Natural language processing

Work on the text column:

Extract people (persName) and add them to a column called persons
Extract places (placeName) and add them to a column called places
Extract organisations (orgName) and place them in the column called organisations


Part 4 - Problem solving/interpreting documentation skills

Using the matplotlib package, create a graph showing the number of tweets per day of the week.
